# windowWIG

The `windowWIG` script simplifies per-nucleotide mappability data in WIG format (as generated by the GEM library [`gem-2-wig`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gemlibrary) script) into a median mappability across a defined window size.

## Usage

~~~
usage: windowWIG [-h] [-v] [-w <n>] <wig>

Generate weighted mean data from a WIG file

positional arguments:
  <wig>                 WIG file to process

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -w <n>, --window <n>  window size
~~~

## Example

THe following code would transform the per-nucleotide mappability data in the `mappability.wig` file into median mappability values with a 10-kilobase window size:

~~~bash
SIZE=10000
windowWIG -w{SIZE} mappability.wig > window-{SIZE}.txt
~~~
